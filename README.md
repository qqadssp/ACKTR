# ACKTR

Minimal implementation of ACKTR. I am not so sure about the detail of the code in kfac.py. I had simplified it a lot, but it was still a little bit hard to me. Maybe I should check it out frequently as I get more knowledge.  

Anyway, it works.  

For more information, pls refer to [ACKTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05144) and [KFAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671).
